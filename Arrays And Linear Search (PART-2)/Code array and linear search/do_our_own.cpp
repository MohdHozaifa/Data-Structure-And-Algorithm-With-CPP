1) Find out what is the use of memset function.
2) int arr[10] = {0}; -> All the values are initialized to 0
   int arr[10] = {1}; -> All values won't be initialized to 1. Find using memset how to initialize with 1 or any particular value other than 0.
3) Implement swap function on your own way. (3 ways) --> Find all.


1) Try union of two arrays with duplicate cases (Using intersection logic, mark common elements as INT_MIN and then use if condition). 
2) Try to find 4 numbers in an array that give sum to a particular value on grounds of triplet and pair sum.
3) Try to solve
  i) left rotate array by one element
  ii) majority element in array
  iii) buy and sell stock - 1
